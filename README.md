# Survival-Prediction

-> Utilized Logistic Regression on a Kaggle dataset to predict survivors of the Titanic steamship, with 85% accuracy.

-> Conducted data cleaning to eliminate corrupted or missing records from the dataset.

-> Achieved an 85% prediction efficiency for survival groups based on passengers' sex, age, and fares.

Libraries needed:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn
6. cufflinks

Step 1: Import the required libraries.

Step 2: Use pandas to read the CSV file.

Step 3: Read the Titanic train.csv file.

Step 4: Create a survivors count bar graph.

Step 6: For ease of use characterize male and female as 1 and 0 respectively. (or vice versa)

Step 7: Create an object of Logistic Regression and generate the classification report.
